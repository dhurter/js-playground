Encapsulation
    - Reduce complexity + increase reusability.
    - Create objects and encapsulate the properties and behavior of those objects

    - In object-oriented programming (OOP), encapsulation refers to the bundling of 
    data with the methods that operate on that data, or the restricting of direct 
    access to some of an object's components.[1] Encapsulation is used to hide the 
    values or state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing unauthorized 
    parties' direct access to them. Publicly accessible methods are generally provided 
    in the class (so-called "getters" and "setters") to access the values, and other 
    client classes call these methods to retrieve and modify the values within the object.

Abstraction
    - Reduce complexity + isolate impact of changes.
    - Process of hiding the complexity of behavior.

Inheritance
    - Elminates redundant code
    - Reuse properties and methods for objects that inherit from parent

Polymorphism
    - Refactor ugly switch/case statements.
    - Allows for specific implementation details to be used based on context.
    - Maybe you have browser controls like textbox, button, checkbox. They each render different on
    a screen but you can still just call a render() method on each that handles the specifcs
    per object type.
